      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an amazon employee learning about web development for the first time.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Upland, CA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games and going to the gym.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job a few years ago would have been a game developer but have since then stopped going to college and hope to still get a similar job using code.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Riverside, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy being on a computer for long periods of time and the oppurtunity to learn web development 
        just happened to present itself so I figured I can learn something new about something I already use all the time. I also
      see there always being a need for websites thus being a demand for people to work on them.</p>
